					Management student at McMaster University actively pursuing
					New Grad 2024 opportunities, with a particular passion for
					full-stack and web development. Proficient in multiple
					programming languages, I'm continuously seeking
					opportunities to expand my knowledge, as I thrive on
					challenging myself to achieve constant improvement.

						I worked on the Data Virtualization product which is
						part of IBM Cloud Pak for Data. As a Back-End Intern I
						worked on various projects using many different tools. I
						improved the efficiency of a security scan by 80% by
						creating a python script that only parses essential JSON
						data into CSV files for developers to assess. I also
						Implemented a db2 user defined function in C that
						integrates a C++ library to support data masking for the
						Data Virtualization platform to ensure data privacy is
						maintained across all user roles. Additionally, I
						created a SQL stored procedure which configured access
						levels for various roles to ensure minimum access policy
						across the platform and I also developed a bash daemon
						script to call this function periodically to constantly
						update user roles as they are created.

						Explored Facebook‚Äôs Production Engineering/DevOps role
						through guided training for Linux, CI/CD, and AWS. I
						made various web applications with Flask and Python and
						hosted them on AWS EC2 instances with CentOS. For each
						project I also implemented cAdvisor to monitor and
						observe performance characteristics of running Docker
						containers in the web app. To auto-deploy changes to the
						project into production and run linters, I created a
						CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. Throughout the
						fellowship we also learned about scripting, so I
						developed automated scripts with Bash to test endpoints
						and send notifications/deployment status via Discord
						through workflow

						Created a cross-platform mobile app with React Native
						for young professionals to connect with peers, engage
						with communities and explore job/extracurricular
						opportunities. I optimized the app‚Äôs UI/UX using React
						Native Accessibility API to provide a smooth experience
						for users with dyslexia and partial blindness. In
						addition to the front-end, I am also developed a REST
						API with express.js to communicate with the back-end
						MongoDB database. Throughout the development process, I
						worked remotely in a team of three in an agile scrum
						environment to maximize productivity. My team also
						worked closely with the client to implement their
						suggestions as they are provided.

						PatchTO is inspired by the need to address unnoticed

						aims to bridge the communication gap between citizens

						authenticate, mark problems on a GTA map, and submit
						details. The map displays surrounding issues, enabling
						upvoting or downvoting based on severity and validity,
						contributing to the resolution of the city's growing
						infrastructure challenges.

						As part of my Engineering Capstone project, I am
						creating a real-time weightlifting movement tracking
						system, the integration involves computer vision,
						sensors, and a smart mirror. Leveraging Python OpenCV
						and MediaPipe for Computer Vision, motion data is
						captured and crucial pose landmarks are extracted for
						meticulous form evaluation. ML Datasets entail
						constructing exercise datasets with Python Scikit-learn
						and Pickle for training algorithms. The Hardware
						Platform utilizes Raspberry Pi 4, complemented by a
						smart mirror interface. Sensor Integration focuses on
						real-time heart rate monitoring, fatigue assessment, and
						pain detection, enhancing user safety and workout
						efficiency. This project showcases a commitment to
						pushing technological boundaries for advanced
						weightlifting solutions.
